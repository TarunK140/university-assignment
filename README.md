🎓 University Admissions Landing Pages — Full Stack Mini Project

This project is a full-stack mini-assignment designed for a Technical Business Analyst / Web Developer evaluation.
It includes two fully responsive landing pages, a lead submission system, mock APIs, and full Netlify deployment.

🚀 Live Demo (Netlify Deployment)

🔗 https://edu-admissions-lp.netlify.app

Both landing pages (LP-1 & LP-2) can be accessed directly from here.

📌 Project Features
🎨 1. Two Fully Designed Landing Pages

LP-1 (index.html) — Starlight University

LP-2 (lp2.html) — Riverview Tech University

Each page includes:

University overview

Courses offered

Facilities

Placement highlights

Modal pop-up for course-wise fee structure

Downloadable professional brochure

Navigation between universities

📝 2. Lead Form With API Integration

Each landing page contains a lead form with:

Full Name

Email

Phone Number

State

Course Interested

Intake Year

Consent Checkbox

✔ Submits data to a Pipedream endpoint
✔ Displays success/error message without reload

💻 3. Backend API (For Development Mode Only)

A simple Express.js backend serves JSON data during local development.

API Endpoints
GET /api/university/:id
GET /api/university/:id/fees


⚠️ Netlify cannot call localhost APIs,
so production uses a static JSON fallback inside main.js.

🧩 4. Modern Frontend (UX-focused)

Clean & polished UI

Glass-effect cards

Smooth modal animations

Fully mobile-responsive

Dark/Light theme toggle

Optimized layout grid

🏆 Challenges & Solutions
1️⃣ Netlify couldn't call localhost API

Problem: CORS + no backend in production
Solution: Static JSON fallback inside main.js.

2️⃣ LP-1 ↔ LP-2 navigation issue

Problem: Wrong paths
Solution: Correct → href="index.html" and href="lp2.html"

3️⃣ Mobile responsiveness issues

Problem: Buttons overflowing screen
Solution: Grid + media queries + flex fixes

4️⃣ Fee modal not opening

Problem: API failure
Solution: Replaced with offline JSON fallback
